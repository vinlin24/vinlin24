## About

Hey there! I'm a graduate student studying Computer Science at UCLA. A coding
enthusiast at heart, I love automating things and building silly projects. I'm
currently:

* Involved with [**Upsilon Pi Epsilon**](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/), the
  Computer Science honor society at UCLA. I served as a chair on the Tutoring
  Committee, which coordinates and hosts exam review sessions and project hacks
  to help give back to the CS community.
* An **Intern &mdash; Software Test Engineer** at [Persistent Systems,
  LLC](https://www.persistentsystems.com/) for Summer 2024.

I love anime, Star Wars, memes, and of course staring at the colored text on my
beloved **Visual Studio Code** ❤️.

My go-to programming languages are **Python** and **TypeScript**/**JavaScript**.
I also have experience with and/or comfortable working knowledge of **shell**
(**Bash**), **C++**, **C**, and **SQL**.

I enjoy programming, both for myself and for others. I'm particularly fond of
**scripting**, writing **unit tests** for class assignments, adding **CLI**s to
anything and everything, and making **Discord bots**! Currently learning more
about and expanding my skills in **full-stack web development**.


## Projects

### ❤️ Hobby Projects


#### 🤖 Discord Bots

* [**yungkaiworldbot**](https://github.com/vinlin24/yungkaiworldbot): Moderation
  & misc. bot for yung kai world, the Discord server for the music artist [yung
  kai](https://linktr.ee/yungkaiboy)!
* [**tacobot-public**](https://github.com/vinlin24/tacobot-public): A bot for my
  friend's server that started as a loose clone of the former [Groovy music
  bot](https://groovy.bot/).


#### 🐚 CLI Applications

* [**counters**](https://github.com/vinlin24/counters): Daily social media bio
  updater *(See my GitHub bio? hehe)*. Now also merged with my
  [**status-logger**](https://github.com/vinlin24/status-logger) project, a
  script that logs my daily Discord custom status.
* [**spotify-serialize**](https://github.com/vinlin24/spotify-serialize): Simple
  Spotify library backup system. This is yet another one of my projects hooked
  up to [Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler)
  to record the evolution of my main playlist over the past year.
* [**strutils**](https://github.com/vinlin24/strutils): Unix-like interfaces to
  Python string utilities. I was in an
  [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) phase 🤷‍♂️.
* [**waifu-roller**](https://github.com/vinlin24/waifu-roller): ...don't ask.
  Also, it's deprecated anyway because I realized I can do the same much more
  reliably with an [AHK script](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Oops.



### 💡 Collaborative Projects

* [**Glossdoor**](https://github.com/lilyorlilypad/Glossdoor-QWERHack): our
  submission for [QWER Hacks 2024](https://www.qwerhacks.com/), a job search and
  rating platform specially designed for underrepresented groups by making DEI
  information and statistics more accessible. We won the **Most QWER Hack** and
  **Most Impactful** awards!
* **CinemaBrain**: an AI movie review generator tool built on [Llama
  2](https://llama.meta.com/llama2), designed to help directors and
  screenwriters predict public movie reception based on synopsis only.
  *(unfortunately closed source at the moment, by wish of my PM.)*
* [**upe-discord-bot**](https://github.com/alexanderhwang02/upe-discord-bot):
  the Discord bot to help with induction at [Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) at
  UCLA](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/), the computer science honor society of which
  I am an active member and officer.


### 📓 UCLA Coursework

* [**cs35l-notebooks**](https://github.com/vinlin24/cs35l-notebooks): Software
  Construction. *(What I'm most known for haha.)*
* [**cs131**](https://github.com/vinlin24/cs131): Programming Languages.

Other repositories from my time at UCLA:

* [**csm152a-lab4**](https://github.com/vinlin24/csm152a-lab4): FGPA Video
  Player (final project for Digital Design Laboratory).
* [**cs118-project1**](https://github.com/vinlin24/cs118-project1): Basic HTTP
  server written in C, capable of serving local files and proxying remote files.
* [**csm151b-ca1**](https://github.com/vinlin24/csm151b-ca1): Simple RISC-V CPU
  simulator.
* [**csm151b-ca2**](https://github.com/vinlin24/csm151b-ca2): Memory hierarchy
  simulator with L1, victim, and L2 caches.

> 🙏 All of my projects are open to issues and pull requests, but these ones
> especially! I believe in free and open-source education material, and the last
> thing I want is spreading wrong information or bad explanations!


### 🧪 Lab Test Suites

Also what I'm known for! I went out of my way to write programs to help develop,
debug, and test class lab assignments across multiple Computer Science courses
during my time at UCLA. These were shared with hundreds of students through
Piazza, and I would like to think they've helped out at least quite a few dozen
of them.

### 🧠 Learning Exercises

~~For when I was procrastinating my actual school work~~ We should all do
something like this from time to time, no?

* [**fixedint**](https://github.com/vinlin24/fixedint): Python implementation of
  fixed size integers.
* [**hashmap**](https://github.com/vinlin24/hashmap): Hashmap implementation in
  C.
* [**brainfuck-exercise**](https://github.com/vinlin24/brainfuck-exercise):
  Implementations of an interpreter for
  [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), intended as learning
  exercises for picking up new programming languages.


### ⚙️ Configuration Backup

I love configuration. Sometimes a bit more than actual development the
configuration was for in the first place.

* [**startup-config**](https://github.com/vinlin24/startup-config): My
  "dotfiles" backup.
* [**scripts**](https://github.com/vinlin24/scripts): PowerShell scripts for
  customizing Windows context menus.


### 📦 That Time I Tried Writing Libraries

<details>
<summary>It was a phase, okay.</summary>

And yes, the title is an isekai reference.
</details>

* [**docgetter**](https://github.com/vinlin24/docgetter): Open Python
  documentation from the command line. *It's on
  [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/docgetter/)!* 💀
* [**spotify-buddylist**](https://github.com/vinlin24/spotify-buddylist): My
  attempt at porting an existing npm package.
