## About

Hey there! I'm a 4th year undergraduate studying Computer Science at UCLA, but I
didn't start that way! I was admitted as Chemistry and had been programming as a
self-taught hobbyist for a few years before I finally switched to what I liked
doing more. A bit late to the party, but I've never been more eager to catch up.
A coding enthusiast at heart, I love automating things and building silly
projects.

<!-- ~~Your stereotypical shut-in.~~ I love anime, Star Wars, memes, and of course
staring at colored text on my screen. -->

<!-- I'm currently involved with:

* 💻 [**Upsilon Pi Epsilon at UCLA**](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/), the Computer
  Science honor society at UCLA.
* 🎬 [**CinemaBrain**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cinemabrain), an AI
  movie review generator tool. -->

<!-- Mah *mains*:

* 📜 **Language:** Python
* 🐚 **Shell:** Bash
* 📝 **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
* 🎨 **Themes:** Dark+ (default dark) for color,
  [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)
  for file icons. They're what keep me staring instead of writing.
* ➡️ **Tabs or spaces:** 4 spaces because the
  [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces) bible says so. Don't
  come after me.
* ⚔️ **Vim or Emacs:** ~~Neither.~~ Emacs...? But probably just because I was
  forced to learn it over Vim.
* 🌐 **HTTP Status:** 418 I'm a teapot! -->

**Currently looking for 2024 SWE roles!**

### 🧪 Lab Test Suites

Also what I'm known for! I went out of my way to write programs to help develop,
debug, and test class lab assignments across multiple Computer Science courses
during my time at UCLA. These were shared with hundreds of students through
Piazza, and I would like to think they've helped out at least quite a few dozen
of them:

* [**test-shuf**](https://github.com/vinlin24/test-shuf): GNU shuf lab.
* [**rr-test-suite**](https://github.com/vinlin24/rr-test-suite): Process
  scheduling lab.
* [**ext2-test-suite**](https://github.com/vinlin24/ext2-test-suite):
  Filesystems lab.
* **[Hash Table Tester Simulator
  (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/vinlin24/ed40765c704e778d96a87dea67654277):**
  Threading lab.
* **[strace Output Filter
  (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/vinlin24/5104f224f8b58178eb72a81bc14e667a):**
  Pipe lab.

This list is also available at [this
Gist](https://gist.github.com/vinlin24/b81bc99736890b349bb874a526c6c61f).


### 🧠 Learning Exercises

~~For when I was procrastinating my actual school work~~ We should all do
something like this from time to time, no?

* [**fixedint**](https://github.com/vinlin24/fixedint): Python implementation of
  fixed size integers.
* [**hashmap**](https://github.com/vinlin24/hashmap): Hashmap implementation in
  C.


### ⚙️ Configuration Backup

I love configuration. Sometimes a bit more than actual development the
configuration was for in the first place.

* [**startup-config**](https://github.com/vinlin24/startup-config): My
  "dotfiles" backup.
* [**scripts**](https://github.com/vinlin24/scripts): PowerShell scripts for
  customizing Windows context menus.


### 📦 That Time I Tried Writing Libraries

<summary>It was a phase, okay.</summary>

And yes, the title is an isekai reference.
</details>

* [**docgetter**](https://github.com/vinlin24/docgetter): Open Python
  documentation from the command line. *It's on
  [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/docgetter/)!* 💀
* [**spotify-buddylist**](https://github.com/vinlin24/spotify-buddylist): My
  attempt at porting an existing npm package.
